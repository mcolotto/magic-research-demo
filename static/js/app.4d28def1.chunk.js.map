While you may cast spells from any schools,\r\n            it will be easier to learn new spells in your primary school. Your\r\n            primary element selection may affect availability and effects of\r\n            various spells, among other things. You will be able to change these\r\n            (via retirement) later in the game.\r\n          </Text>\r\n        </View>\r\n        <UtilityCard>\r\n          <Card.Title accessibilityRole=\"header\">Schools</Card.Title>\r\n          <Markdown>{primarySchoolText}</Markdown>\r\n          <View>\r\n            <ButtonGroup\r\n              pressableProps={{ accessibilityRole: \"button\" }}\r\n              buttonStyle={\r\n                theme.theme.mode === \"dark\" && {\r\n                  borderColor: theme.theme.colors.grey5,\r\n                  borderBottomWidth: StyleSheet.hairlineWidth,\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n              containerStyle={[\r\n                styles.buttonGroupContainer,\r\n                theme.theme.mode === \"dark\" && {\r\n                  backgroundColor: theme.theme.colors.grey4,\r\n                  borderColor: theme.theme.colors.grey5,\r\n                  borderBottomWidth: 0,\r\n                },\r\n              ]}\r\n              textStyle={[\r\n                styles.buttonGroupText,\r\n                theme.theme.mode === \"dark\" && { color: \"#fff\" },\r\n              ]}\r\n              vertical={true}\r\n              onPress={setSelectedSchoolIndex}\r\n              selectedIndex={selectedSchoolIndex}\r\n              buttons={schools}\r\n            />\r\n          </View>\r\n          <View>\r\n            {selectedSchoolIndex != undefined && (\r\n              <View>\r\n                <Markdown>\r\n                  {schoolDescriptionMap[schools[selectedSchoolIndex]]}\r\n                </Markdown>\r\n                {selectedMPL > 0 ?

Completed events require no further action on your part. Ongoing events, on the other hand, mean that you haven't reached the end of the event for some reason.

There are three schools of magic: **Conjuration**, which mostly allows you to create resources such as :stone: and :water:; **Enchantment** that allows you to improve the performance of your buildings; and **Illusion** which allows you to obtain more :coins:.

So, for example, being away for 8 hours will result in you earning 28.8K :timepiece: once you open the game again.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to use this resource. The first one is to **double the game speed** at a cost of 3 :timepiece:/sec. You can toggle this from the left hand side menu. The second one is called *\"Use Time Pieces (Warp)\"* and lets you spend 3000 :timepiece: to **skip ahead 10 minutes of gameplay**. You can do this from the Campus screen. The last one is called *\"Use Time Pieces (Research)\"* and lets you spend 3000 :timepiece: at once to **get 25 real-time minutes of Research**. You can do this in the Campus or Research screen.\r\n\r\nThe best way to use Time Pieces depends on your current situation. Doubling the game speed is quite cheap and can make all the aspects of the game pass a lot faster. If you do not have enough time to play the game actively, Warp can help you make a lot of progress in a small amount of time, especially if you prepare the game to be effective without you having to put manual action. 10 real-time minutes can boost you quite far, so you may only need to use this once or twice to reach the goal that you're aiming for.

One example: ordering apprentices to cast *Enchant Mana Spouts* will let you get the vastly improved :mana: production without having to make a clear effort to cast the enchantment over and over.\r\n    \r\nIn order for an apprentice to be able to cast a spell, your school level for that spell needs to be one level higher than the level required to unlock it. For example, for *Enchant Mana Spouts*, you need Enchantment Lv1 to cast it - but you need Enchantment Lv2 for apprentices to be able to cast it for you.\r\n\r\n**Apprentices cast each spell once every 60 seconds.** If you want apprentices to cast a spell faster, you can **assign multiple apprentices to the same spell** which will increase the frequency of the spell proportionally. For example, **2 apprentices would cast the spell twice per minute (once every 30 seconds)**, 3 apprentices would cast it three times per minute (once every 20 seconds), 4 apprentices would be 4 times per minute (once every 15 seconds), and so on.\r\n\r\nIf a spell cannot be cast when an apprentice attempts to cast it, usually because there is not enough :mana:Mana, the apprentice will cast the spell as soon as it is able to.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it can be useful to have apprentices stop casting spells temporarily. You can pause apprentices with the **Pause Apprentices** button at the bottom of this screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as you play the game you will face different situations which means you will want to have different spells being cast automatically. You can use **Loadouts** for this, at the bottom of the Apprentices screen. Saving to a loadout will record your current apprentice assignment to the specified slot.

Likewise, against an enemy with high :defense:, even just a little more :attack: can increase the total damage drastically. \r\n\r\nThere are two additional combat stats: :attackDelay:Attack Delay affects how often you (or the enemy) attack, while :hpRegen:HP Regen automatically recovers your :hp: over time.\r\n\r\nYou can also manually use items or cast spells from the bottom of the **Combat** screen, which can help give you an edge.

In essence, retiring allows you to restart the game from the beginning, including choosing a new primary school and element. However, there are strong benefits to retirement which are detailed below.\r\n    \r\nWhen you retire, the level your primary school is currently at is permanently recorded. This level is called the **Maximum Primary Level**, or **MPL**. The MPL for a school can never go down - if you re-select a school as your primary and then retire again without reaching your previous MPL, you will keep the previous value.\r\n\r\nAfter you retire, you will get a **Global Research Multiplier**. This multiplier is very important, as it can vastly improve the effectiveness of research, letting you unlock stronger spells much, much quicker.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a similar **Global Production Multiplier** which will affect all resource production you have from buildings and other features in the game. This includes Mana, which means after retirement it should be much easier to cast stronger spells or cast spells more often. This also affects loot.\r\n\r\nBoth of the multipliers above are determined based on two factors. The first is the maximum MPL you have ever achieved, regardless of school. This is the main factor impacting the two multipliers. The second is the sum of all the MPLs you have across all the schools. This is a secondary factor and it will impact the multipliers, but not as much.\r\n\r\nOne last benefit from retirement is related to Storylines. Any **benefits acquired from Storylines will persist through retirements**, meaning progress will become faster. In addition, some Storylines only provide their benefit after you retire once - retiring is encouraged in order to get the full benefit in those cases.\r\n\r\nDeciding when to retire is very important. One suggestion is to retire if progress has gotten slower or achieving the next Goal (see: **Introduction** help section) appears impossible. Another is to retire if the research and production multipliers will substantially increase, or if you complete a Storyline with powerful effects that only appear after retirement.`,\r\n  });\r\n  Helps.register({\r\n    title: \"Storylines\",\r\n    isVisible: (state) => true,\r\n    order: 510,\r\n    description: `**Storylines** are special events.

If you happen to come across a Storyline event, you should complete it if possible, as the benefits can often significantly change how the game plays.\r\n\r\nStorylines only provide benefits and there are no drawbacks. If there is a choice inside a Storyline, you will be able to make a different choice later if you encounter the Storyline again after retirement, and possibly reach a different ending that provides a different benefit. Bonuses from completed Storylines never go away, even if you finish the same Storyline again with a different ending.\r\n\r\nStorylines represent progress through the game, and as a player one of the goals of the game is to complete every Storyline.
