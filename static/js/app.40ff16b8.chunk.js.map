Pressing on any event will let you see the last message of the event, and you can check out the previous messages by using the arrows at the top of the dialog.    \r\n\r\nEvents are **very important** in the game, as most progress ends up happening via events that trigger when certain actions are done.\r\n\r\nEvents can be either *Completed* or *Ongoing*. Completed events require no further action on your part. Ongoing events, on the other hand, mean that you haven't reached the end of the event for some reason. If possible, you should strive to complete all ongoing events. If you have ongoing events, the notification bell icon will show a number in red indicating this fact.\r\n\r\nThere is a special kind of event called **Storyline**.

You can obtain Mana by gathering it manually in your Campus, or via buildings like the Mana Spouts.\r\n    \r\nSpells are divided into **schools of magic**. These roughly group spells by a theme. There are three schools of magic: **Conjuration**, which mostly allows you to create resources such as :stone: and :water:; **Enchantment** that allows you to improve the performance of your buildings; and **Illusion** which allows you to obtain more :coins:. (Or are there really just these three...?)\r\n\r\nUsing spells from a certain school will give you experience on that school. Eventually, the school level will increase, which will usually unlock new spells.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the game, you selected a *primary school of magic*.

This is very useful for **automating** several of the actions you typically do. One example: ordering apprentices to cast *Enchant Mana Spouts* will let you get the vastly improved :mana: production without having to make a clear effort to cast the enchantment over and over.\r\n    \r\nIn order for an apprentice to be able to cast a spell, your school level for that spell needs to be one level higher than the level required to unlock it. For example, for *Enchant Mana Spouts*, you need Enchantment Lv1 to cast it - but you need Enchantment Lv2 for apprentices to be able to cast it for you.\r\n\r\n**Apprentices cast each spell once every 60 seconds.** If you want apprentices to cast a spell faster, you can **assign multiple apprentices to the same spell** which will increase the frequency of the spell proportionally. For example, **2 apprentices would cast the spell twice per minute (once every 30 seconds)**, 3 apprentices would cast it three times per minute (once every 20 seconds), 4 apprentices would be 4 times per minute (once every 15 seconds), and so on.\r\n\r\nIf a spell cannot be cast when an apprentice attempts to cast it, usually because there is not enough :mana:Mana, the apprentice will cast the spell as soon as it is able to.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it can be useful to have apprentices stop casting spells temporarily. You can pause apprentices with the **Pause Apprentices** button at the bottom of this screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as you play the game you will face different situations which means you will want to have different spells being cast automatically. You can use **Loadouts** for this, at the bottom of the Apprentices screen. Saving to a loadout will record your current apprentice assignment to the specified slot. You can then load it later to go back to that assignment.`,\r\n  });\r\n  Helps.register({\r\n    title: \"Inventory and Crafting\",\r\n    isVisible: (state) => hasFlag(state, \"inventory_unlocked\"),\r\n    order: 130,\r\n    description: `In the **Inventory** screen, you are able to see the *items* you have accumulated and crafted.

From that interface, you can select an item and, if you have the materials, you can create the item. The materials are either resources or other items.\r\n\r\nYou can unlock new items to craft by increasing your school levels. Conjuration and Enchantment typically unlock new items to craft, but other schools may also unlock new items. In some cases, some items may require a certain level from multiple schools at once. For example, the item \"Branch\" requires Lv4 Conjuration and Lv4 Enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe **Sort Inventory** button in this screen places items in this order: Consumables, Hand, Body, Accessory, and the rest.

Once the exploration finishes, the headmaster will begin combat against an enemy. \r\n\r\nIf combat is successful, you will earn :coins:, :monstium: and possibly some items.

These rewards are shown on the Exploration screen as they are obtained.\r\n\r\nIf combat is unsuccessful, the headmaster will be defeated and will wait until its health is fully recovered before exploring again.\r\n\r\nAfter succeeding in combat a certain number of times, a *Boss* is unlocked for the area, which is exceptionally strong.

The general damage calculation for any attack is: Attack's :attack: - 0.5x Target's :defense:. A little extra :defense: can be pretty effective at reducing damage, especially for weaker attacks. Likewise, against an enemy with high :defense:, even just a little more :attack: can increase the total damage drastically. \r\n\r\nThere are two additional combat stats: :attackDelay:Attack Delay affects how often you (or the enemy) attack, while :hpRegen:HP Regen automatically recovers your :hp: over time.\r\n\r\nYou can also manually use items or cast spells from the bottom of the **Combat** screen, which can help give you an edge.

In essence, retiring allows you to restart the game from the beginning, including choosing a new primary school and element. However, there are strong benefits to retirement which are detailed below.\r\n    \r\nWhen you retire, the level your primary school is currently at is permanently recorded. This level is called the **Maximum Primary Level**, or **MPL**. The MPL for a school can never go down - if you re-select a school as your primary and then retire again without reaching your previous MPL, you will keep the previous value.\r\n\r\nAfter you retire, you will get a **Global Research Multiplier**. This multiplier is very important, as it can vastly improve the effectiveness of research, letting you unlock stronger spells much, much quicker.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a similar **Global Production Multiplier** which will affect all resource production you have from buildings and other features in the game. This includes Mana, which means after retirement it should be much easier to cast stronger spells or cast spells more often. This also affects loot.\r\n\r\nBoth of the multipliers above are determined based on two factors. The first is the maximum MPL you have ever achieved, regardless of school. This is the main factor impacting the two multipliers. The second is the sum of all the MPLs you have across all the schools. This is a secondary factor and it will impact the multipliers, but not as much.\r\n\r\nOne last benefit from retirement is related to Storylines. Any **benefits acquired from Storylines will persist through retirements**, meaning progress will become faster. In addition, some Storylines only provide their benefit after you retire once - retiring is encouraged in order to get the full benefit in those cases.\r\n\r\nDeciding when to retire is very important. One suggestion is to retire if progress has gotten slower or achieving the next Goal (see: **Introduction** help section) appears impossible. Another is to retire if the research and production multipliers will substantially increase, or if you complete a Storyline with powerful effects that only appear after retirement.`,\r\n  });\r\n  Helps.register({\r\n    title: \"Storylines\",\r\n    isVisible: (state) => true,\r\n    order: 510,\r\n    description: `**Storylines** are special events.

If you happen to come across a Storyline event, you should complete it if possible, as the benefits can often significantly change how the game plays.\r\n\r\nStorylines only provide benefits and there are no drawbacks. If there is a choice inside a Storyline, you will be able to make a different choice later if you encounter the Storyline again after retirement, and possibly reach a different ending that provides a different benefit. Bonuses from completed Storylines never go away, even if you finish the same Storyline again with a different ending.\r\n\r\nStorylines represent progress through the game, and as a player one of the goals of the game is to complete every Storyline.
