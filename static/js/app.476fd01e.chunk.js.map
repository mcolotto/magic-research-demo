While you may cast spells from any schools,\r\n            it will be easier to learn new spells in your primary school. Your\r\n            primary element selection may affect availability and effects of\r\n            various spells, among other things. You will be able to change this\r\n            (via retirement) later in the game.\r\n          </Text>\r\n        </View>\r\n        <Card>\r\n          <Card.Title>Schools</Card.Title>\r\n          <Text>Please choose a primary school of magic.</Text>\r\n          <View>\r\n            <ButtonGroup\r\n              containerStyle={styles.buttonGroupContainer}\r\n              textStyle={styles.buttonGroupText}\r\n              vertical={true}\r\n              onPress={setSelectedSchoolIndex}\r\n              selectedIndex={selectedSchoolIndex}\r\n              buttons={schools}\r\n            />\r\n          </View>\r\n          <View>\r\n            {selectedSchoolIndex != undefined && (\r\n              <View>\r\n                <Markdown>\r\n                  {schoolDescriptionMap[schools[selectedSchoolIndex]]}\r\n                </Markdown>\r\n                {selectedMPL > 0 ?
