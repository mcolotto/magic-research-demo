Completed events require no further action on your part. Ongoing events, on the other hand, mean that you haven't reached the end of the event for some reason.

One example: ordering apprentices to cast *Enchant Mana Spouts* will let you get the vastly improved :mana: production without having to make a clear effort to cast the enchantment over and over.\r\n    \r\nIn order for an apprentice to be able to cast a spell, your school level for that spell needs to be one level higher than the level required to unlock it. For example, for *Enchant Mana Spouts*, you need Enchantment Lv1 to cast it - but you need Enchantment Lv2 for apprentices to be able to cast it for you.\r\n\r\n**Apprentices cast each spell once every 60 seconds.** If you want apprentices to cast a spell faster, you can **assign multiple apprentices to the same spell** which will increase the frequency of the spell proportionally. For example, **2 apprentices would cast the spell twice per minute (once every 30 seconds)**, 3 apprentices would cast it three times per minute (once every 20 seconds), 4 apprentices would be 4 times per minute (once every 15 seconds), and so on.\r\n\r\nIf a spell cannot be cast when an apprentice attempts to cast it, usually because there is not enough :mana:Mana, the apprentice will cast the spell as soon as it is able to.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it can be useful to have apprentices stop casting spells temporarily. You can pause apprentices with the **Pause Apprentices** button at the bottom of this screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as you play the game you will face different situations which means you will want to have different spells being cast automatically. You can use **Loadouts** for this, at the bottom of the Apprentices screen. Saving to a loadout will record your current apprentice assignment to the specified slot. You can then load it later to go back to that assignment.`,\r\n  });\r\n  Helps.register({\r\n    title: \"Inventory and Crafting\",\r\n    isVisible: (state) => hasFlag(state, \"inventory_unlocked\"),\r\n    order: 130,\r\n    description: `In the **Inventory** screen, you are able to see the *items* you have accumulated and crafted.

For example, the item \"Branch\" requires Lv4 Conjuration and Lv4 Enchantment.\r\n\r\n**Note: If you are unable to craft an item even though you have the materials, your inventory might be full!

In essence, retiring allows you to restart the game from the beginning, including choosing a new primary school and element. However, there are strong benefits to retirement which are detailed below.\r\n    \r\nWhen you retire, the level your primary school is currently at is permanently recorded. This level is called the **Maximum Primary Level**, or **MPL**. After you retire, you will get a **Global Research Multiplier** depending on the highest **MPL** you have achieved for every school. This multiplier is very important, as it can vastly improve the effectiveness of research, letting you unlock stronger spells much, much quicker.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a similar **Global Production Multiplier** which will affect all resource production you have from buildings and other features in the game. This includes Mana, which means after retirement it should be much easier to cast stronger spells or cast spells more often. This also affects loot.\r\n\r\nOne last benefit from retirement is related to Storylines. Any **benefits acquired from Storylines will persist through retirements**, meaning progress will become faster. In addition, some Storylines only provide their benefit after you retire once - retiring is encouraged in order to get the full benefit in those cases.\r\n\r\nDeciding when to retire is very important. One suggestion is to retire if progress has gotten slower or achieving the next Goal (see: **Introduction** help section) appears impossible. Another is to retire if the research and production multipliers will substantially increase, or if you complete a Storyline with powerful effects that only appear after retirement.`,\r\n  });\r\n  Helps.register({\r\n    title: \"Storylines\",\r\n    isVisible: (state) => true,\r\n    order: 510,\r\n    description: `**Storylines** are special events.
