For example, **2 apprentices would cast the spell twice per minute (once every 30 seconds)**, 3 apprentices would cast it three times per minute (once every 20 seconds), 4 apprentices would be 4 times per minute (once every 15 seconds), and so on.\r\n\r\nIf a spell cannot be cast when an apprentice attempts to cast it, usually because there is not enough :mana:Mana, the apprentice will cast the spell as soon as it is able to.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it can be useful to have apprentices stop casting spells temporarily. You can pause apprentices with the **Pause Apprentices** button at the bottom of this screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as you play the game you will face different situations which means you will want to have different spells being cast automatically.
